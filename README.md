## Assessing Growth Mindset-Related Attitudes

In these studies we assessed university students' implicit attitudes towards criticism and challenge. 
The preliminary studies include semantic network plots of people's word associations for the terms criticism, challenge and failure. 
The pilot studies include smaller studies conducted to test whether the implicit measures' predicted explicit beliefs and behaviors. 
The main study involves a bigger study, where we tested whether the implicit measures were predictive of the PERC score (growth mindset mastery behaviors).
